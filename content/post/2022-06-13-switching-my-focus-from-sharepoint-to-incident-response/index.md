Okay, so when I left my former employee (Avanade) about two years ago, I did that with a purpose and a plan in mind.

I was always curious about cyber security topics. Nothing in particular - but always looking here and there.

When I decided to leave, I did this because of three things:

1. I never wanted to do management stuff - and I had to do that quite a lot.
2. I wanted to come back to more technical topics.
3. I wanted to switch to a cyber security domain within the next few years.

My current employer gave me a lot of opportunities to come back to the technical side of IT. And that was great. Have been doing a lot of SharePoint infrastructure and migration topics. But they couldn't provide me the possibility to get in-depth learning on security topics.

## The obstacle

Well, I'm doing the stuff I'm doing for almost 10 years. In cyber security, I have no hands-on experience other than playing around with some stuff in my spare time. I have a family and therefore I have a monetary and timely responsibility for my kids and my wife. So switching to a topic where I will re-start as a junior and lower pay was always a hinder for me.

But boy, am I lucky!

## The way

I have a wife who's so supportive that I'm almost feeling guilty. And I found an employer, who's willing to take the risk of building me up from the ground - and supports me on the monetary side as well.

Therefore I'm switching to a SOC role and so the focus of this blog will also change towards this topic as well.

I'll keep you updated on my journey through the rough seas of zeros and ones and share my experience with learning new topics like Microsoft Defender, KQL, security basics and so on.

Stay tuned and so long...

For my daily work I need to do a lot on the command line with Powershell. I'm using cmder for that. But in the default configuration cmder is starting a Windows Console session. Would be much easier if it directly starts a Powershell session instead. Here's how to do that.

Go to the settings of cmder and change the 'task' of the tab 'Start Up' to the task which is starting Powershell.  
Wow. What a sentence!

Done!  
So long ...

Part 1 of my posts on how to become a SOC analyst from scratch. This post will cover what a SOC analyst is supposed to do.

****DISCLAIMER |**** Please remember that everything I'm writing about is based on my personal context. Of course, role descriptions might differ from company to company and don't reflect what I'm writing here.

## Everyday tasks for a SOC analyst

There is a daily business that has to be done every single day by all SOC analysts. And there are more particular topics that various analysts will cover. That's why it is common for all analysts to share a subset of the same skills. Besides that, everyone has a specialization.

## Standard operating procedures

Standard operating procedures [\[0\]](#[0]) - or SOPs - are defined work patterns within set boundaries that help staff do their job consistently and approvedly. In many cases, you can think of SOPs as something like a checklist.

SOC analysts monitor and investigate alerts and incidents based on SOPs. But depending on how the SOC is run, the list of tasks is likely to extend to:

- writing reports regarding ongoing threats and findings from internal investigations
- implementing security features to improve the client's security posture
- prepare and update status slides for communication purposes to the client

SOPs will probably consume most of the analyst's working day. Though in a best-case scenario, you'll take half the day for your SOPs and use the rest for one of the following topics.

## Improving operations

It is challenging work to keep all the daily operations up and running. So any minute spent improving the processes and tooling around a SOCs ongoing is well spent time.

## Security projects

Another critical aspect of working as a SOC analyst is contributing to security-related projects. These projects can be efforts to improve a given security product or become better in specific procedures.

To name just some well-known topics in that area: Automation and detection.

## Learning

'IT' is notoriously well-known as an industry where learning is vital.  
Therefore it is not surprising that some employers reserve a fixed amount of time for their employees dedicated to learning.

For example, in the beginning, I used almost all my time getting used to Microsoft 365 Defender products. To be more precise: How to use the monitoring and investigating part of the Defender products.

Later I was able to pick some other topics as well. Like hunting with KQL and writing Threat Intel reports. I am trying to increase my knowledge of and become better at this right now.

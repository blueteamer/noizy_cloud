Security was more something like an interest for me. As it is now becoming a profession, I need to skill up myself to be productive and keep up with all the changes.

## My profile

As it is easier to follow along with a similar background, let me tell you about my background so you can find matchings to yours.

### What I formerly did

I've been working as a consultant for SharePoint (on-prem and online). That means in my case a lot of discussions and arguments with clients and their management about how to use products to match their demands. The technical side was not the focus of this job.

### Skills I can already bring up to the party

- Communication skills
- Requirement engineering
- Critical thinking
- Understanding of SharePoint architecture (probably pretty obsolete now for me)
- Basic understanding of Windows networks and OS
- PowerShell scripting

### What I need to learn

- How to use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Common duties and tasks of a SOC analysts
- Cyber Security Frameworks
- Proficiency in PowerShell
- KQL

Of course this is only true for the next weeks and months as there is a lot more to learn. But let's start easy and then ramp up the pace.

**INFO |** Meanwhile, some kind of a disclaimer... Everything I provide here is under constant change as I might have to switch directions depending on what comes up on my way. So please don't take this stuff as granted or promised or what ever. Thx.

## What's next?

In the next post I'll give you an overview of resources I'm currently using to get familiar with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, together with some additional info on basics which I find valuable to know.

I'll try to update this blog once a week fridays.

So long...

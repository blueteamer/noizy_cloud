In this post we will take a look on resources I'm currently using to get to know Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## The first steps

For the beginning I set up this plan to get started with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and becoming a SOC analyst.

- Set up a **[trial instance](https://aka.ms/mdetrial)** of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Watch the **Virtual Ninja Training** session on **[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRFdd4GCZ-Y&list=PLmAptfqzxVEXzbOYvCMjXJQuAwpqnACZ4)** or **[Microsoft](https://aka.ms/ninjashow)**
- Read and understand in detail the resources on **[Become a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Ninja](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/become-a-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-ninja/ba-p/1515647)**

## Set up MDE Trial for training purposes

To follow all the steps described in the Ninja Training or other resources, it is helpful to have a demo environment. Luckily Microsoft got you covered on that.

Under [**https://aka.ms/mdetrial**](https://aka.ms/mdetrial) you can subscribe to a demo MDE environment where you can deploy virtual machines, run predefined attacks and investigate the capabilities of MDE in a safe environment.

What do you need for that?

Well, I recommend to create a burner Microsoft account. You can do that by signing up a dummy account on [**https://outlook.com**](https://outlook.com).

Then, [**sign up for the MDE trial**](https://aka.ms/mdetrial) using your newly created Microsoft account. During the sign up process you will be asked to create another account for MDE. That's the account you will be working on in MDE.

Now, you can start getting familiar with the MDE portal and all the stuff provided in that.

## The Ninja Training

### Virtual Ninja Training (aka Ninja Show)

Microsoft provides a video series based on the Tech Community Blog article [**Become a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Ninja**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/become-a-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-ninja/ba-p/1515647). It's hosted by [Heike Ritter](https://twitter.com/HeikeRitter) and accompanied by several technical experts from Microsoft. These sessions (aka [Ninja Show](https://aka.ms/ninjashow)) give you a different and comprehensive view on aspects of the MDE Ninja learning path and MDE's features and capabilities.

**If you are a webcast learner, I recommend starting with this video series to get an overview of what MDE is and what you can accomplish with it.**

**Info|** Season 1 is based on the **Security Operations Fundamentals** part of the MDE Ninja path. Session 2 is up to be released soon, according to Microsoft.

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Ninja Training

The original source of the Ninja training.

Heike Ritter did an awesome job on gathering a lot of resources within Microsoft and curated a nice list as a training path for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

The Ninja Training consists of links to Microsoft Docs, short intro videos, interactive learning content and external webcasts (e. .g SANS).

Use those resources to get an overall knowledge and later a deeper understanding of MDE

**Info|** If you already know about the basics of MDE - i. e. what MDE actually is and what features it has, you can skip the fundamentals part of it. The real fun starts with the intermediate section.

## Take-aways and learnings

I started with the **Virtual Ninja Training** to get a high level overview of what is part of MDE, what it does and where to click to accomplish specific tasks. That took me about 2 - 3 days as I watched some episodes several times to get everything out of that.

After that - or sometimes in parallel - I walked through the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Ninja Training - Fundamentals** section. As I already heard about the topics via the Virtual Ninja Training it was much easier to follow along the content.

On the whole, it took me around one week to finish the Fundamentals part of the MDE Ninja Training. This included also the set up of the MDE Trial and demo VMs, too.

Anything, that wasn't so good?

Well, some of the content from the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Ninja Training are a little bit marketing-ish. If you already have some experience and some background info, it can become dull to follow that content. I did that anyways - just to make sure to not miss anything out. And honestly, it's worth it to get a bold foundation.

Another thing that you should consider is the usage of the VMs within the MDE Trial. The VMs included are free of cost - with the drawback, that the VMs can only be run for a limited time per month. For me, not long enough to learn in a comfortable way.

Therefore, I used an old notebook with Win 10 Ent and Hyper-V installed. Then set up three VMs with Win 10 and one with Server 2022. ISOs can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Evaluation page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter). The installations are valid for 180 days. That's ok for me - compared to e. g. 72h included by the MDE Trial. :)

## Next steps

So this was week 1 and I already could take a lot away with the info provided by Microsoft alone.

Next I'm going to work myself through the intermediate section and prepare the next post.

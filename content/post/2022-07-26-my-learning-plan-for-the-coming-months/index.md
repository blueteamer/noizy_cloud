Over the coming months, I will be collecting topics and resources here that will help me prepare for my new role.

## Why this post

In the not-too-distant future, I will take on a new role. And for this role, I need some skills that I can not yet call my own.

So below you will find a list of topics and resources that should help me with this task or have already helped me.

So, here we go.

## The list

### PowerShell, Git & GitHub

PowerShell has long been part of my daily toolbox. However, I never felt the urge to perfect scripting in PowerShell. The same goes for using Git or GitHub. And that although the advantages are obvious.

### Microsoft Defender

Microsoft Defender will become part of my life in the long run. And since I'm so completely lacking in experience and knowledge here, I'm starting from scratch.

### Kusto Query Language

KQL is the query language that is used in the Microsoft Cloud area for the most diverse queries of log events. Certainly not useless to learn this language.

## Conclusion

If you have any suggestions on what else could be of interest for someone starting in a CSOC and with Microsoft Security Topics, let me know in the comments. Thx!

So long...

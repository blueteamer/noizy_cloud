Most of you probably already had contact with it. The overall-mystic MD-Files.

At least if you have been working with GitHub you have seen a **Readme.md** file. But what is that file?

## The MD File

It is easy to see, that md stands for **markdown**. Markdown is an easy to use formatting syntax, similar to html (funfact: which is a markup language). Markdown can be used to quickly and fast format content without leaving the keyboard. In the end the result will be a text file with additional formatting information applied.

## Common markdowns

| Markdown | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| # | Level 1 heading | \# Level 1 heading |
| ## | Level 2 heading | \## Level 2 heading |
| \* | Italic | \*some italic text\* |
| \*\* | Bold | \*\*some bold text here\*\* |
| \*\*\* | Italic AND bold | \*\*\*so important italic and bold\*\*\* |
| \> | Blockquote | \> Citing others is pretty odd |
| 1. | Ordered list | 1\. First element  
1\. Second element  
1\. Third element |
| \- | Unordered list | \- First element  
\- Second element  
\- Third element |

**Markdown** is a pretty commonly used syntax for creating documentation in the IT. Therefore I highly recommend taking a look into the basics to be prepared in case you somewhen need it for work.

I personally use Markdown for creating longer text passages like article and blog posts. I like the idea of focusing on the content and just having a minimal formatting on-the-fly while writing.

## Wanna try it out

You can use one of the many online Markdown editors in the "internet" if you want to give it a try. I can recommend [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) to get started. But be aware, that [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) supports additional Markdowns which are not part of the default set of formatting options.

Learning new things is simply part of most professions. This is especially true in IT, where requirements and technology are constantly evolving.

My three favorite methods for remembering what I have learned in the long term are **recalling information**, **spaced repetition** and the so-called **Feynman method**.  
In this post, I'd like to briefly introduce these three methods.

## Recall

A simple trick to remember content better after you have read, seen or heard anything: Pause briefly and summarize the most important points in your head on your own. This helps to retain the information more easily since you have actively dealt with the topic in your mind.

I use this technique when reading chapters since they already form thematically summarized content anyway. After reading a chapter I pause for around half a minute and try to memorize what I've actually read. Sounds natural but usually - due to time pressure - you're likely to avoid this step.

Of course, this only works if you can determine the learning speed by yourself. But in my case, it was a game-changer.

## Spaced Repetition

In the words of Bart Simpson, "It's my job to be repetitive. My job. My job. Repetitiveness is my job."

In short, you're doing what most pupils are doing when they have to learn a poem by heart.  
Read it once. Wait some time. Read it again. Wait some time. Give it another round. Until the info is chiseled into your brain. :)

Of course, this is certainly not suitable for all topics. I do this mainly for hands-on topics like clicking through configurations or memorizing certain procedures.

## Feynman Method

The Feynman Method is a bit more elaborate and is useful if you want to learn a technical context. It is a cyclical process that incorporates, refines, and consolidates parts of both methods from above.  
Feynman gives four steps for this:

1. Define the subject and get a first overview
2. Try to explain this topic to someone else
3. Recognize your knowledge gaps while explaining and close them by learning again - then try to explain the topic again
4. Finally, simplify the topic in your explanation as much as possible.

Imagine you want to understand the topic of Conditional Access in Microsoft 365. To do this, you read through Microsoft's documentation and/or watch videos on the topic.

Now, as you have a rough understanding of Conditional Access, try to explain it to someone else.  
I usually do the explaining by writing a blog article or by telling a colleague about it.

But now you realize that parts of your explanation don't make sense or are not elaborated enough. So, go back to learning, close the knowledge gap and revise the article.

If you have fully succeeded in explaining the topic without having to resort to the sources, you are ready and you can try to simplify the explanation further. For example, by using appropriate metaphors and working around technical terms.

## Summary

Learning to learn is not easy and does not work the same for everyone. I myself have tried different methods for myself and get along quite well with these three.

Am I a proven expert at the end of such a process? Not at all. For this, a certain something is missing: experience in the field. But it is a very good basis to get a foothold in a specialist area, for example, in order to be able to work there. Experience comes with time.

With this in mind: Happy learning and so long...

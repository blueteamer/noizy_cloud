I’ve been an IT consultant for over a decade until I decided to focus on a different field within IT.

In 2022 I switched to operations and started as a SOC analyst. Besides triage and incident response within Microsoft Defender, I focus on Threat Intelligence and Malware Analysis.

Follow me to join my journey and see what’s next.
